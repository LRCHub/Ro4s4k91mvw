Mastery of life and death
When you hold the law within your hands
Tremendous wrath with empty eyes
Your degradation will never die
Each move you make is my control
To penetrate your inner soul
Your sensual thoughts begin to cease
When I kill you in your peaceful dreams
Glock 'n' roll glock 'n' glory
When you look into my eyes glock 'n' roll
Glock 'n' glory
A world of torment and despise
You can't disguise you can't escape
Wherever you will hide involve yoursеlf
Within my hate just for a little smile
Glock 'n' roll glock 'n' glory
Whеn you look into my eyes glock 'n' roll
Glock 'n' glory
A world of torment and despise
I'm a fragile monstrosity
Sustained fire frequency
No gold or jewels grace your face
Wearing bullet holes instead
Leaping by the gun cadence
Ballistical co-efficiency
Devastating shock effects calculated well
Glock 'n' roll glock 'n' glory
When you look into my eyes glock 'n' roll
Glock 'n' glory
A world of torment and despise
You can't disguise you can't escape
Wherever you will hide involve yourself
Within my hate just for a little smile
Glock 'n' roll glock 'n' glory
When you look into my eyes glock 'n' roll
Glock 'n' glory
A world of torment and despise
Depopulation, justification
Perpetrator in the mire
Manipulated, decimated
Your world will end tonight
Decivilized, sodomized death inseminated
Instigation, revelation
Prevalence ruled by pain
Prevalence ruled by pain
