Everyone falls
You know sometime
Sometimes, it's wrong
And sometimes, it's right
For every win
Someone must fail
There comes a point when
When we exhale
Said shoop, shoop, shoop
Hold my Glock
when I'm in the club
It's some hoes in the back
and they wanna come show me love
Took my dogs to the strip
and I spent a dirty dub
Hold my Glock
when I'm in the club
It's some hoes in the back
and they wanna come show me love
Took my dogs to the strip
and I spent a dirty dub
Oh, oh
Hold my Glock
when I'm in the club
It's some hoes in the back
and they wanna come show me love
Took my dogs to the strip
and I spent a dirty dub
Oh, oh
Hold my Glock
when I'm in the club
It's some hoes in the back
and they wanna come show me love
Took my dogs to the strip
and I spent a dirty dub
Oh, oh

Geeked up (Uh-huh)

It's time to pop my meds,
I need a re-up (Yeah, yeah)
Huh, red two-seater (Skrrt)
Marley got that tune,

Braids to the back
like Queen Latifah
I can't feel my face,
I'm in here so gone
Hold my Glock
when I'm in the club
It's some hoes in the back
and they wanna come show me love
Took my dogs to the strip
and I spent a dirty dub
Oh, oh
Hold my Glock
when I'm in the club
It's some hoes in the back
and they wanna come show me love
Took my dogs to the strip
and I spent a dirty dub
Oh, oh
Wanna come fuck you

Pull up, baby right to sleep,

Stayin' high, stayin' low-key,

You don't even be doin' it,
if it ain't me, yeah
I felt the love,
I wonder what she felt
(Felt the love)
I hide the Glock
right by my seatbelt
(Right by my seatbelt)
Hey, bae
I want that new Chanelly purse
I bought you
I need you to hold my Glock

I need you to hold my Glock
Hold my Glock

It's some hoes in the back

Took my dogs to the strip
and I spent a dirty dub
Oh, oh

It's some hoes in the back
and they wanna come show me love
